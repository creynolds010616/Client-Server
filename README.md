# Client-Server: Group project for client-server computing

This project loads two categories of quotes, Chuck Norris and inspirations, into a server. The quotes are requested by a mobile Android client by category. The server responds by randomly generating the index for the corresponding quote genre.

Completed this when everything was shut down for 3+ months for COVID.
